## Sketch Your Own GAN Fork

Work done by Akshay Dharmavaram and Mayank Mali in partial fullfillment of 16-824: Visual Learning and Recognition while at CMU.

This repository is a component of [TroGAN: Disguising Contours to Look Like Sketches](https://github.com/Aks-Dmv/TroGAN). It contains the modified GAN sketching and incorporated CUT translation model (c2s mode by default).

Please note that this repository is forked and modified from the [Sketch Your Own GAN](https://peterwang512.github.io/GANSketching/) project.
